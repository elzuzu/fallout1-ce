# Fallout Community Edition

Fallout Community Edition is a fully working re-implementation of Fallout, with the same original gameplay, engine bugfixes, and some quality of life improvements. This fork targets **64-bit Windows** only.

There is also [Fallout 2 Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout2-ce).

## Project Status

- Runs on modern **64-bit Windows** only.
- Experimental Vulkan renderer available via `RENDER_BACKEND=VULKAN` or the
  `FALLOUT_RENDER_BACKEND` environment variable.
- Keyboard layout is detected automatically on Windows.

## Installation

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38400). Download latest [release](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce/releases) or build from source. You can also check latest [debug](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce/actions) build intended for testers.

### Windows

Download and copy `fallout-ce.exe` to your `Fallout` folder. It serves as a drop-in replacement for `falloutw.exe`.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `fallout.cfg`. There are several important settings you might need to adjust for your installation. Depending on your Fallout distribution main game assets `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data` folder might be either all lowercased, or all uppercased. You can either update `master_dat`, `critter_dat`, `master_patches` and `critter_patches` settings to match your file names, or rename files to match entries in your `fallout.cfg`.

The `sound` folder (with `music` folder inside) might be located either in `data` folder, or be in the Fallout folder. Update `music_path1` setting to match your hierarchy, usually it's `data/sound/music/` or `sound/music/`. Make sure it match your path exactly (so it might be `SOUND/MUSIC/` if you've installed Fallout from CD). Music files themselves (with `ACM` extension) should be all uppercased, regardless of `sound` and `music` folders.

The second configuration file is `f1_res.ini`. Use it to change game window size and enable/disable fullscreen mode.

```ini
[MAIN]
SCR_WIDTH=1280
SCR_HEIGHT=720
WINDOWED=1
RENDER_BACKEND=SDL
```

Use `RENDER_BACKEND=VULKAN` to enable the experimental Vulkan renderer. This
setting can also be overridden by the `FALLOUT_RENDER_BACKEND` environment
variable.

Recommendations:
- **Desktops**: Use any size you see fit.
- **Tablets**: Set these values to logical resolution of your device, for example iPad Pro 11 is 1668x2388 (pixels), but it's logical resolution is 834x1194 (points).
- **Mobile phones**: Set height to 480, calculate width according to your device screen (aspect) ratio, for example Samsung S21 is 20:9 device, so the width should be 480 * 20 / 9 = 1067.

In time this stuff will receive in-game interface, right now you have to do it manually.

## Contributing

Here is a couple of current goals. Open up an issue if you have suggestion or feature request.

- **Update to v1.2**. This project is based on Reference Edition which implements v1.1 released in November 1997. There is a newer v1.2 released in March 1998 which at least contains important multilingual support.

- **Backport some Fallout 2 features**. Fallout 2 (with some Sfall additions) added many great improvements and quality of life enhancements to the original Fallout engine. Many deserve to be backported to Fallout 1. Keep in mind this is a different game, with slightly different gameplay balance (which is a fragile thing on its own).
